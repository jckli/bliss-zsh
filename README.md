> **Note**: The modifications are all just personal modifications to the theme to make it work better for me. If you are looking for the original, please head over to [bliss-zsh](https://github.com/joshjon/bliss-zsh). Also, I don't use the bliss iTerm theme (don't use iTerm2), so theres no fork for that.
